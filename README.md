### Objective

Design a simple box to house all components.

### Discussion

The overall design of the box was intended with accessibilty in mind to the components. This would allow for frequent procedures such as debugging, component swaps, etc to be done more easily. The full assembly of the box can be separated into three components: main box, box cover, and bolts. 

The main box (Refer to Figure 1) is a rectangular container with quarter circles protruding from all of the inner corners. Within those quarter circles are holes for the bolts to fixate the top box cover to the main box. In addition, at the front of the main box, a slit and hole can be found for usb connection to the microcontroller and power cable to the power barrel jack (assuming the power is supplied from outside the box) respectively. 

The top cover (Refer to Figure 2)
